This branch of the Demo subtree contains sample table functions.

This code is now built as part of the standard Derby build.
To build the javadoc, invoke the demodocs target in the top level
build script.

Two sql scripts are provided to test-drive these table functions.
Use Derby's ij tool to run these scripts:

1)  sql/demoFileVtis.sql
2)  sql/demoForeignDbmsVtis.sql

1) The first script needs to be customized as explained in the
script's header.

This first script exercises the following table functions:

a) PropertyFileVTI - a table function for presenting a property file
as a table.

b) XmlVTI - a table function for presenting an arbitrary XML file as
a table.

c) ApacheServerLogVTI - an example of an XmlVTI which makes a table
out of an Apache web server log.

d) DerbyJiraReportVTI - an example of an XmlVTI which makes a table
out of a JIRA report.

e) SubversionLogVTI - a table function for making a table from the
output of the "svn log" command.


2) The second script runs table functions against the sample MySQL
database called "world". To run this script, you must be running a
MySQL server which manages the world database. You will also need
to customize this script as its header explains. The second script
exercises the following machinery:

a) A table function which queries the CountryLanguage table in the
MySQL database.

b) A parameterized subscription from several tables in the MySQL
database. This subscription is defined by an annotated class called
WorldDBSnapshot.
